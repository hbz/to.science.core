The Toolbox Science is an open source framework of services based on the fedora-commons repository software. 
The frameworks aim is to provide APIs to variant third party systems while beeing open to all kind of materials 
and internal structrures of materials. The Toolbox Science is feasable for monographs, series, journals, research 
data, open educational resources and website archives. 
Therefore the Toolbox is thought to be the swiss knife in the Open Access Repository world. 

To fulfill these expections the Toolbox Science on the one hand makes heavy use of the fedora-commons flexibe 
storage system and on the other hand provides a framework of RESTful API, which is used in a self consuming manner.
